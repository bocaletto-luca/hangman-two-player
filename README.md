## Overview

**Hangman Web Game Two Player VS** brings the classic word-guessing game to your browser in a head-to-head multiplayer format. In this version, one player submits a secret word while the opponent guesses letters to reveal it. Featuring an interactive interface, real-time score tracking, and responsive design, this web game is built entirely with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply host the files on any HTTP/HTTPS server (e.g., using Apache or GitHub Pages) and open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage

- **Game Objective:**  
  One player sets a secret word, and the opponent tries to guess it letter by letter. Each incorrect guess brings the hangman closer to completion, while correct guesses reveal the hidden word.

  1. **Setup:** Player One enters a secret word (this can be hidden from Player Two).  
  2. **Guessing:** Player Two selects letters to guess the word.  
  3. **Scoring:** Points are awarded based on correct guesses and remaining chances.
  4. **Rounds:** After a round, roles can be swapped to let both players enjoy the challenge.

- **Controls:**  
  Use your keyboard or on-screen buttons for letter selection, and follow the interactive prompts during gameplay.

## Technologies Used
